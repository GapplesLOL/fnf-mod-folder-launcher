# fnf-mod-folder-launcher
Have you ever wanted to launch your FNF executables but you have to click into tons of stupid folder to find them? Well do that no longer! I've designed a simple python program that requires no additional downloads besides python, that will run all your FNF mods with the press of a button!
Make sure that python is installed via the microsoft store. This launcher was made using Python 3.13, but I will update it periodically.
Note: This launcher was made by me. If you use it, please give credit, I put a lot of time and energy into making this. In the future I might even add customizable themes!
