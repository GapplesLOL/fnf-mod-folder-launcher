# fnf-mod-folder-launcher
Have you ever wanted to launch your FNF executables but you have to click into tons of stupid folders just to find them? Well do that no longer! I've designed a simple python program that requires no additional downloads besides python, that will run all your FNF mods with the press of a button!
Make sure that python is installed via the microsoft store. This launcher was made using Python 3.13, but I will update it periodically.
Note: This launcher was made by me. If you use it, please give credit, I put a lot of time and energy into making this. Update: THERE ARE NOW PREBUILT THEMES, AND CUSTOM THEMES, WHICH WILL BE SAVED TO YOUR PC!
Additionally, feel free to report any glitches, bugs, etc. to my personal email, gapplesgodrulez@gmail.com, or to the comments section of this project!
